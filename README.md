 FX's scripts for science and chemistry
======================================

This rep contains scripts that I use regularly, in the hope that others
might find them useful. Below is a description of each, roughly classified
by "category".


**Bibliography**

- `doi2bib`: give it a DOI, it gives you a full bib entry
- `extractdoi`: gets DOI from PDF (when possible)
- `texsize`: list size of all figures included in TeX document
- `text2doi`: get DOI from references in text format (one per line)

**Computational chemistry**

- `crystal2cif`: extract information from CRYSTAL17 output file into CIF format
- `findsym.py`: find space group of crystal structures (front-end to ASE/spglib routines)

**Misc tools**

- `unicode`: display the characters in a Unicode string
